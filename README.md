# Laptop Price Prediction
Predicting laptop prices using machine learning. This project leverages a dataset containing various features such as manufacturer, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and more to train a machine learning model capable of predicting laptop prices. The process involves thorough data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and the application of a Random Forest Classifier.

## Key Steps:
## Data Exploration
Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure.
Check for missing values and analyze basic statistics.
## Data Preprocessing
Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Assess multicollinearity through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) calculations.
Drop unnecessary columns to enhance model efficiency.
## Data Visualization
Create visualizations to understand relationships between variables.
Utilize pair plots and heatmaps for better insights.
## Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
## Choosing & Training Model
Implement a Random Forest Classifier for predicting laptop prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using R2 Score.
## Results
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.0908% in predicting laptop prices.
